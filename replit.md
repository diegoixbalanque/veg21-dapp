# VEG21 - Vegan Habit Tracker

## Overview
VEG21 is a blockchain-based web application designed to promote and gamify vegan lifestyle adoption through 21-day challenges. It integrates habit tracking, social impact, and cryptocurrency rewards (VEG21 tokens) to create an engaging ecosystem. The platform enables users to participate in vegan challenges, contribute to community causes, and earn rewards, fostering environmental sustainability and a growing vegan community. Key features include a global impact leaderboard, user profiles, onboarding flows, community feed with recipe sharing, daily check-ins with proof upload, and a token simulation layer with transaction tracking, all preparing for Celo Testnet integration.

## System Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter (routing), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui (component library), TanStack Query (server state).
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, modular storage interface, middleware pipeline.
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect, schema-first approach, migration support.

### UI/UX and Design
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, responsive design (mobile-first), custom vegan-themed color palette, CSS custom properties for theming.
- **Components**: High-quality, accessible React components built on Radix UI.
- **Visuals**: Crown/medal icons for leaderboard, custom avatars, progress bars, milestone badges, camera icons for proof uploads.

### Feature Specifications
- **Leaderboard System**: Global ranking based on VEG21 tokens earned, donations, and staking rewards; community impact metrics dashboard; localStorage persistence.
- **User Profile & Onboarding**: Multi-step onboarding with challenge selection (meat-free, vegan breakfasts, full vegan, zero waste); editable user profiles with challenge progress, personal statistics, and gamification elements (badges); localStorage persistence.
- **Community Feed & Recipe Sharing**: Multi-type content system (recipes, tips, experiences) with forms; engagement features (likes, comments); content filtering; real-time community statistics; localStorage persistence.
- **Enhanced Onboarding & Challenge Flow**: User registration, daily check-ins with photo/video proof upload (mock), community validation for check-ins, automatic 21-day challenge completion detection with +50 VEG21 bonus, leaderboard integration; localStorage persistence.
- **Token Simulation & Transaction System**: Comprehensive transaction history (claims, transfers, donations, staking); peer-to-peer VEG21 token transfers with balance validation; community activity feed displaying real-time token events; localStorage persistence for transactions.

### Blockchain and Web3 Integration (Mainnet Ready)
- **Multi-Network Support**: Full configuration for Celo Alfajores testnet (chainId 44787), Celo Mainnet (chainId 42220), Astar Shibuya (chainId 81), local Hardhat (chainId 31337), and Demo mode with environment-based switching via VEG21_MODE variable.
- **Network Configuration**: Centralized configuration in `client/src/config/chainConfig.ts` with NetworkConfig interface defining chainId, name, displayName, RPC URL, block explorer, native currency, and testnet flag for each supported network.
- **Smart Contracts**: Complete VEG21 contract suite ready for deployment:
  - VEG21Token: ERC20 with minting/burning (18 decimals, 1M initial supply)
  - VEG21Staking: 10% APR staking rewards system
  - VEG21Donations: Charity donations with token burning
  - VEG21Rewards: Challenge completion rewards (+50 VEG21 for 21-day completion)
  - All contracts use OpenZeppelin libraries with role-based access control
- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Production-ready deployment system with:
  - Enhanced scripts/deploy.ts with --dry-run (simulation) and --execute (real deployment) modes
  - Mainnet safety guards: 10-second abort window, balance checks, gas estimation
  - scripts/validate_config.sh for environment validation
  - Private key validation guards preventing deployment without proper credentials
  - Default demo mode (no blockchain/private key required)
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask connection for real blockchain; demo wallet mode with localStorage simulation; enhanced wallet connection state management.
- **Mode Indicators**: Visual banners showing current mode:
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple banner: Demo Mode (safe, no transactions)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow banner: Testnet Mode (Celo Alfajores, free test CELO)
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green banner: Mainnet Mode (Celo, real money)
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Demo mode localStorage simulation with seamless upgrade path to testnet/mainnet blockchain contracts.
- **Migration Path**: Clear deployment pathway: Demo (default) â†’ Celo Alfajores (testnet) â†’ Celo Mainnet (production)
- **Security**: Safe by default - no sensitive data in repository, private key validation, deployment confirmation required, .gitignore protection.

### State Management
- **Client-side**: React Query for server state caching, custom hooks for wallet and mobile detection, React Context for shared UI state (toasts, modals).
