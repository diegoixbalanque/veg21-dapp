VEG21 currently has a functional 21-day challenge system, but users report confusion about how challenges start, how progress works, what rewards mean, and how a challenge is considered “completed.”

The goal is NOT to add new features or smart contracts, but to clarify, simplify, and solidify the existing challenge system so it feels complete, meaningful, and usable for non-Web3 users.

Objective

Define and improve the 21-day challenge system so that:

Challenges feel like a complete cycle (start → progress → completion).

Rewards are consistent and understandable.

Users clearly know what to do each day.

Completing a challenge feels emotionally and conceptually “finished”.

The system can later evolve into community-created challenges without refactoring.

Scope (Strictly UX, Copy, and Logic Clarification)

Do NOT:

Add new blockchain logic

Add smart contracts

Add community-created challenges yet

Add OAuth or auth-related work

Focus only on challenge system clarity.

Tasks to Plan
1. Challenge Definition Cleanup

Review how challenges are currently defined (hardcoded array).

Remove or fix the misleading estimatedReward values.

Standardize all official challenges to a single clear reward:

Completing any 21-day challenge grants 600 VEG21 points, distributed across milestones.

Ensure challenge cards reflect accurate, honest information.

2. Clear “What Happens Next” After Challenge Selection

After a user selects a challenge, add a short confirmation/explanation step:

“Your challenge starts today”

“Do one daily check-in to progress”

“Milestones and rewards:

Day 1: 50 VEG21

Day 7: 100 VEG21

Day 14: 150 VEG21

Day 21: 300 VEG21”

This can be a simple modal or inline message—no new UI complexity required.

3. Daily Progress Context

Improve the challenge tracker messaging so the user always understands:

What day they are on

What they should do today

What the next milestone is

Examples:

Day 1: “Complete your first check-in to earn 50 VEG21”

Day 5: “2 days left until your first milestone”

Day 7: “Milestone unlocked! Claim your reward”

This should be done via copy changes, not new logic.

4. Clarify Daily Tasks

Currently, daily tasks are generic and not challenge-specific.

Do one of the following (choose the simplest):

Rename “Daily Task” → “Daily Inspiration”

Add helper text:

“These are general suggestions to support your vegan habit during the challenge.”

No new task logic needed.

5. Reward Meaning Explanation (First Claim Only)

When the user claims their first milestone reward, show a short explanation:

“VEG21 points represent your progress and impact in the vegan community.
You earn them by staying consistent with your habits.”

This should only appear once.

6. Clear Challenge Completion State (Day 21)

When the user completes day 21:

Show a simple Challenge Completed message or screen:

Congratulatory text

Total VEG21 earned

Message like:

“You completed a full 21-day habit cycle.”

Add a clear next-step prompt (even if not functional yet):

“You can start another challenge or repeat this one.”

This is conceptual closure, not feature expansion.

Success Criteria

After these changes:

A non-Web3 user can explain how the challenge works in one sentence.

Rewards feel consistent and trustworthy.

Completing a challenge feels like a real accomplishment.

No mismatch between UI promises and actual behavior.

The system feels “finished,” not like a demo loop.

Deliverable

A reviewed and documented challenge flow

Updated copy and minor logic alignment

No new dependencies or architectural changes
