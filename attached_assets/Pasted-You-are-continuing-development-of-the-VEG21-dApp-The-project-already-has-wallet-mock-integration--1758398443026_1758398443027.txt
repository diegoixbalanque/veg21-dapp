You are continuing development of the VEG21 dApp.  
The project already has wallet mock integration, challenge tracker with milestone rewards, donation system, staking, and a transaction-based user activity feed.  
Do not remove or overwrite existing functionality — extend it incrementally.

### Sprint 5 Goals:
1. **Global Impact Leaderboard**
   - Create a new `Leaderboard` component/page.
   - Rank users by:
     - Total VEG21 tokens earned (rewards).
     - Total donations contributed.
     - Total staking rewards accumulated.
   - Provide both **global ranking** and **personal ranking** (highlight the current user).
   - Use mock data for other users, combined with the current user’s real stats from `mockWeb3`.

2. **Impact Metrics**
   - Show cumulative statistics at the top of the leaderboard:
     - Total tokens distributed via rewards.
     - Total tokens donated to community funds.
     - Total tokens currently staked.
   - All values should update dynamically from the mockWeb3 state.

3. **UI/UX**
   - Each leaderboard row should show:
     - Rank position
     - User address/username
     - Tokens earned, donated, and staked
   - Highlight the logged-in wallet (mock) in the list with a special style.
   - Add badges/medals for top 3 positions.

4. **Persistence**
   - Ensure leaderboard and impact stats are saved to localStorage and reloaded on refresh.
   - Keep using mockWeb3 as the source of truth for current user stats.

### Deliverables for Sprint 5:
- A new `Leaderboard` component integrated into navigation.
- Ranking table with mock users + current user.
- Dynamic impact metrics summary.
- Styled UI with medal/badge indicators.
- State persistence using localStorage.

**Important Notes:**
- Do not remove or break existing features (wallet connection, rewards, donations, staking, activity feed).
- Work incrementally and test after each step.
- Use mock data for global leaderboard until real backend/blockchain integration is added in later sprints.
