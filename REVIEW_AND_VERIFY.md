### Functional Testing
- [ ] **Token**: Transfer 10 VEG21 between two test wallets

- [ ] **Staking**: Wait 24 hours, claim rewards, verify 10% APR calculation
- [ ] **Staking**: Unstake and verify tokens returned to wallet
- [ ] **Donations**: Donate 20 VEG21 to test charity
- [ ] **Donations**: Verify tokens burned (totalSupply decreased)
- [ ] **Rewards**: Unlock milestone reward
- [ ] **Rewards**: Claim reward and verify balance increase

### Event Emission
- [ ] `Transfer` events emitted on token transfers
- [ ] `Staked` events emitted on staking
- [ ] `Unstaked` events emitted on unstaking

### Permission Testing
- [ ] Non-owner cannot mint tokens (should revert)
- [ ] Non-minter cannot call restricted functions
- [ ] Owner can pause/unpause in emergency
- [ ] Minter role can be granted/revoked by owner
